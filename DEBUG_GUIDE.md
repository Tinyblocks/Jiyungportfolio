# Project Page Debug Guide

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Text Overlap Problem ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Thumbnail previews overlapping with description text
**Solution**: 
- Increased bottom margin on `.carousel__thumbs` from 24px to 48px
- Added proper z-index stacking (thumbs: z-index 5, description: z-index 1)
- Removed top margin from `.project__description` to prevent double spacing

### 2. Back Button Styling Inconsistency ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Different project pages using different back button classes
**Solution**: 
- Updated ALL project pages to use consistent `class="back"` with SVG icon
- Removed old `class="button"` instances with text arrows
- Now all pages have identical glass morphism back button styling

### 3. Image Loading Debug System ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Issue**: Second images appearing empty/invisible
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive console logging to track image loading
- Debug output shows: total slides, image sources, loading status, dimensions
- Error handling for failed image loads
- Final status check on page load completion

## Debug Console Output

When you visit a project page, check the browser console for:

```
Carousel Debug Info:
Total slides: 2
Total thumbs: 2
Slide 1: ../images/Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 11.56.32.png
Slide 2: ../images/Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 11.56.42.png
Image 1 src: ../images/Screenshot 2025-09-01 at 11.56.32.png
Image 1 complete: true
Image 1 naturalWidth: [width]
✅ Image 1 already loaded - Width: [width]px
✅ Image 2 already loaded - Width: [width]px
Page fully loaded, checking image status:
Final status - Image 1: ✅ LOADED
Final status - Image 2: ✅ LOADED
```

## Files Modified

1. **styles.css**: Fixed thumbnail positioning and z-index stacking
2. **All project pages**: Consistent back button styling + debug logging
3. **Carousel structure**: Proper spacing and layout hierarchy

## Testing

1. **Thumbnail Positioning**: Thumbnails should appear clearly separated from description text
2. **Back Button**: All project pages should have identical glass morphism back buttons
3. **Image Loading**: Console should show all images loading successfully
4. **Navigation**: Arrow buttons and thumbnails should hide on single-image projects

## Next Steps for Further Debug

If images still don't load:
1. Check browser Network tab for 404 errors
2. Verify image file paths match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Check if images are corrupted or have permission issues
4. Try loading images directly in browser: `http://localhost:5173/images/[filename]`

## Layout Verification

The layout should now have:
- Fixed sidebar (doesn't scroll with content)
- Carousel with proper viewport sizing (70vh, 400-600px range)
- Clear separation between thumbnails and description
- Consistent back button across all project pages
- Debug logging in console for troubleshooting
