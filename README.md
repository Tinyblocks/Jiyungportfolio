Admin (Decap CMS)
-----------------

- Open `/admin` to add/edit Projects
- Drag & drop images; they are saved under `images/uploads/` by default
- Publishing creates/updates files in `src/projects/`

Deployment (Netlify suggested)
------------------------------

1. Push to GitHub
2. Create a new Netlify site from the repo
3. Build command: `npm run build`  Publish directory: `_site`
4. Enable Identity + Git Gateway for CMS logins
5. Invite Jiyung via Netlify Identity. She will log in at `/admin`.

Notes
-----

- Existing static pages (`about.html`) are still served as-is.
- Homepage tiles are generated from content; filters remain on the client.
- You can keep images in current folders; CMS uploads go to `images/uploads/`.
